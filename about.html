                I’m Eshaan, a Product Designer at Flipkart working on Fintech - Advanz Ecosystem (Pay Later, EMIs..) & Co-branded Credit Card.

              <p>
                Before joining Flipkart, I was a designer at Playment, and where I worked upon the data annotation crowdsourcing platform and design systems.

                Before getting into design, I pursued computer engineering and was an early designer in Brisky & 1THING.</p>
              <p>I've had extensive experience across product and design. I'm curious about solving problems related to financial inclusion and productivity, creativity, and art.</p>
              <p>I love poking things with a stick; lately generative art, venture capital world; perpetually striving to showcase my photography.</p>
