shippedDate: Jan 2019 - Present
overview:
  - Playment is a fully managed data labeling platform that generates training data for computer vision models at scale using crowdsourcing. The motto is to empower companies in the Autonomous Vehicle, Drones, Mapping, and similar spaces with high precision annotation services. We are a young company backed by Y-Combinator and SAIF Partners; we have helped the likes of Nio, Didi Chuxing..

  - At the core of our platform, is a trained workforce of 300,000+ users (Players/Annotators) managed by their human intelligence experts who build annotation tasks on the training data and deliver results with assured quality.
outcome:
  - No outcome yet, as this is an ongoing project.
  - However, in the process of pursuing this project I’ve opened the door to the world of Swift and iOS development, so in that sense it’s already a great success.
