During my time at Brisky, I understood the true sense of responsibility that is required to outdo at a startup - it is that moment of your life when you 'Go Big or Go Home'. If you’re in a startup, you do whatever it takes to push things forward. Everyone here did just that. It could just be ordering a water can—whatever needs to get done, you do it. All of which contributes to the entrepreneurial spirit felt throughout the company. My encounter was no different, it was truly vital and the best any fresh graduate student could ask for. This place indeed laid the foundational phase of continuous learning.

At Brisky, I worked as a full-stack designer and was contributing to all segments of the company; not only design, but also operations, business, and marketing. Being the sole designer in a startup can pose lots of difficulties, but the struggle and hard work are definitely conducive. I spent the early months of my career making banners, which taught me about composition, animation, storytelling, copywriting, brand consistency and so much more. Making marketing collaterals became my masterclass in design – something I frowned upon at that time, but it taught me whatever job you have, you can choose what you get out of it.

My experience at Brisky was nothing short of that of a life-changing one. Firstly, because I worked on all the fronts of the product, and this came with a steep learning curve. Brisky was accelerated by Spark10 (A London based Startup Accelerator) and started off as 'Your Concierge to Nightlife Discovery'. Our approach to a product-market fit for the restaurants made progress in two directions - first of them being the Consumer-end edition and second, Business edition.

Secondly, because I was working closely with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jatin-bhatia-45609353/" target="_blank">Jatin Bhatia</a>, who single-handed pushed me to think beyond the conventional means, from first principles and mentored me into the Startup Ecosystem.

Rethinking Brisky
{: .post-paragraph-embedded-title}

We defined our primary user story as “I want to find something fun to do this weekend.” To meet this need, we reshaped our event discovery experience across our products to bring more life, levity, and fun to the experience.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

To become a trusted destination we needed to transform our data to be more city-centric and integrate curated editorial content. For this effort, my role was to redesign and restructure the visual language across the Android and iOS apps and to lead the product conceptualization for the social feeds.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

Through various channels of understanding user journeys, we were able to identify a significant growth opportunity in the social segment, which was one of the most essential features that I launched. In the Social Segment, users could interact with their peer groups and agree on a place or a gig.

Creating Focused Experiences
{: .post-paragraph-embedded-title}

To create an engaging browsing experience we needed to design an onboarding process that would be both delightful to complete and useful in shaping our user's discovery experience. We wanted to reinforce our ‘Restaurant Recognition’ logic into the event listings and restaurant profiles themselves - this would, in turn, help build trust around the content we provide in our Mobile Application.

Brisky Business
{: .post-paragraph-embedded-title}

Brisky Business helps brick and mortar businesses(restaurants) automate their customer interaction. Automating critical tasks like customer re-engagement, feedback collection, etc. helps businesses in providing a superior customer experience.

For Brisky Business, I laid the foundation of the product whose primary users were managers and the representatives of the restaurants who check-in customers.We observed that the restaurant industry has always had a great desire to adopt new technologies and make data-driven decisions. However, like any other end-user, they are not willing to put the effort of going through charts, deriving correlations and splicing data sets to get the insights. What they are looking for is someone to tell them what actions they should take.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

Key Metrics Include: 60 paying clients with ARR of \$40,000. NPS of 76. Achieved net churn of 20%. DAU/MAU ratio of 80%, reflecting the high usage of the product.
