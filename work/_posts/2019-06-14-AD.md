shippedDate: Nov 2020 - Present
overview: The Grocery Voice Assistant was Flipkart’s foray into utilizing voice technology to tap into the emerging markets of India. 
    - More than a million new internet users come online every day, many of whom wouldn't be able to interact with technology at all without voice input. It may seem obvious that voice is a helpful interaction method for moments when you're unable to type, like when you're driving a car or are cooking in the kitchen. In reality, voice is not only helpful - it's critical- for many people's daily engagements with technology. 
    - Many new internet users struggle with lower literacy and depend on voice to interact with technology. Voice empowers many users to do things themselves, without the assistance of others, increasing confidence while exploring the internet.
    - In spite of the great potential of what the technology provided its users - Flipkart’s grocery assistant was struggling to establish ground. It contributed to only 0.3% of Total Order that were place on Flipkart and we had observed a low engagement. From our user survey studies, we had identified a set of hypothesis which were primarily based on the gaps in the interaction model of the assistant.

As a product designer, in the Conversation Assistant team, I led the Voice User Interaction (VUI) design to solve the identified gaps in the interaction model.  I collaborated with the developers and conversational designers to realize this solution, as we tried to effectively optimize the interplay of touch and voice modalities within the constraints of what a low-end device could offer us.
