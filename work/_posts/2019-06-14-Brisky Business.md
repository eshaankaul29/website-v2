During my time at Brisky, I understood the true value of commitment that is required to excel at a startup - it is that time of your life when you have to 'Go Big or Go Home'. My experience was no different, it was truly significant and best any newly graduated student could ask for. This place indeed laid the foundation of a phase of continuous learning.

At Brisky, I worked as a full-stack designer and was contributing to all segments of the company; not only design, but also operations, business, and marketing. Being the sole designer in a startup can pose lots of difficulties, but the struggle and hard work is definitely fruitful.My experience at Brisky was nothing short of that of a life-changing one.

Firstly, I worked on all fronts of the product, and this came with a steep learning curve. Brisky, accelerated by Spark10 (A London based Startup Accelerator), started as 'Your Concierge to Nightlife Discovery' and our approach to a product-market fit for the restaurants made progress in two directions - first of them being the Consumer-end edition and second, Business edition.

Secondly, because I was working closely with Jatin Bhatia, who single-handed pushed me to think beyond the conventional means, from first principles and mentored me into the Startup Ecosystem.

Rethinking Brisky
{: .post-paragraph-embedded-title}

We defined our primary user story as “I want to find something fun to do this weekend.”. To meet this need, we reshaped our event discovery experience across our ecosystem to bring more life, levity, and fun to the experience.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

To become a trusted destination we needed to transform our data to be more city-centric and integrate curated editorial content. For this effort, my role was to redesign and restructure the visual language across the Android and iOS app and to lead the product vision for the social feeds.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

Through various channels of understanding user journeys, we were able to identify a significant growth opportunity in the social segment, which was one of the most vital features that I launched. In the Social Segment, users could interact with their peer groups and come to a consensus about a place or an event.

Creating focused experiences
{: .post-paragraph-embedded-title}

To create an engaging browsing experience we needed to design an onboarding process that would be both delightful to complete and useful in shaping our user's discovery experience. We wanted to reinforce our ‘Restaurant Recognition’ logic into the event listings and restaurant profiles themselves - this would in turn help build trust around the content we provide in our Mobile Application.

The Nomad sharing experience. Sender experience (top) and receiver experience (bottom).
{: .post-caption}

Both collections and places can be shared. Sharing a collection takes place from the top-level collection view and utilizes your contacts.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

After accepting the sender’s invitation, the receiver’s app imports the sender’s collection, which is visually delineated from the collections the receiver has created on their own.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

Accepting a collection from a sender also “subscribes“ the receiver to the collection and means they will receive any future updates from the sender. This feature is meant to open the door for local collections, where you could keep running lists of places and activities in your city.
