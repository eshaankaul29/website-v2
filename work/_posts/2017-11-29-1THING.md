At 1THING, I was working closely with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashankm19/">Shashank Hudkar</a>, who was the VP - Design, we worked together on 1THING’s main product offering and were also responsible for working hands-on some of the most challenging projects revolving around user-centered, product thinking solutions and UX assignments from clients, such as Paytm.

Designing for a complex product which involves crowdsourcing was never going to be a piece of cake. Designing an enterprise software is a whole new universe - the constraints, the complexities, the stakeholders, the rules of governance, the features, the functionalities, the technicalities, dozens of personas, and hundreds of use-cases. It's all just amazingly thought-provoking.

Another major offering by 1THING was a technology-driven, AI-powered Workspace-As-A-Service (WaaS) for startups & businesses. I was one of the guardians of this product and it was my duty to hire right design teams for those businesses who we were providing the services to. This made the collaboration between the businesses and all things design at 1Thing far more smoother.

Our core product offering came in as an all-in platform to Hire, Collaborate, and Manage the Design Team. A marketplace model, where a vetted, passionate designer meets his/her visionary client. We curate a design team based on client’s requirements and collaborated with them to deliver a great user experience.

Problems?
{: .post-paragraph-embedded-title}

There were lots of questions. The first year we pretty much ran like an agency. When we looked deeper into the real world case-studies such as Uber & Airbnb. At some point later, we stumbled upon Gigster, which was is ‘Uber’-ising software development. There lay our answers.

We decided to to build a fully-automated & intelligent design platform of the future, which would combine & Top Design Talent - a platform that would simplify End-to-End process from Hiring to Collaboration to Delivery. It would also construct a framework in which designers could earn well, deliver quality even when working remotely. This would bring a major transformation in the way designing in product teams is outsourced at the moment. There were advantages for the hiring company too, they would now be able to hire designers from anywhere, save well and attain with guaranteed quality. By 2018, we had delivered over 50+ products via a network of 100+ top designers from India & Outside helping companies like PayTM, UAE-Xchange, Tata, RBL Bank, WeddingWire & many many more.

Rebranding
{: .post-paragraph-embedded-title}

In early 2018, we underwent a major brand overhaul and I worked with Shashank to closely establish the changed ideology behind the company as a strong brand identity. During this activity, I thoroughly researched the best practices of morphing company ethics to a strong visual identity and new trends in the industries. I also went out of my way to try a 3D realism within the Branding and after-effecting my way to a launch video with Kartik Lalit . You can get a glimpse of the concept in this presentation.

Why Rebrand?
{: .post-paragraph-embedded-title}
1.Unclear identity. Our logo didn’t serve as an identifying anchor point for the company.
2.The requirement for an identity which reflects the essence of the company and at the same time is aligned with our new found vision.
3.We were perceived as just-another-design-company (a marginally improved version of a DA) in almost every way.
4.Was working like a transactional relationship, rather than an everlasting relationship.
