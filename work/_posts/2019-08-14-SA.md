Adding a place pulls in associated metadata from Apple Maps and gives you a chance to leave a brief note alongside the place, which can be edited later. This note is a good way to remember something key to the experience and it will be visible to those with whom you share the place.

Both collections and places can be shared. Sharing a collection takes place from the top-level collection view and utilizes your contacts.

“Friction is bad. We try to eliminate it. But, it has a purpose. It protects against risk. OTPs, credit checks, ref checks -have friction that protects. The art of removing friction - respect its role, find alternatives that manage risk & then slay it.”

Accepting a collection from a sender also “subscribes“ the receiver to the collection and means they will receive any future updates from the sender. This feature is meant to open the door for local collections, where you could keep running lists of places and activities in your city.
