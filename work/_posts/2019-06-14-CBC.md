overview:
  - A CBC is a Joint Payment Proposition between a retail merchant (Flipkart), bank (Axis Bank) and a card network (Mastercard, Visa etc.) 
  - Co-branded Credit Cards programs have accelerated benefits offering the card (on the earn side, burn side or both) and is a widely used tool to drive loyalty and repeat purchases. One can earn reward points with each purchase you make, big or small. In the Flipkart CBC, Rewards = Cash back directly subtracted from your bill amount at every month.

Card Designs Research Activity
{: .post-caption}

As a product designer on the CBC team I was on the field, doing research before Flipkart’s Co-branded Card (CBC) went live. We were in Bhopal, India talking to cardholders (Credit or debit), understanding their delight and pain points. ​The objective of the study is threefold: 1. Test the value proposition of Flipkart’s upcoming CBC. 2. Test Usability of CBC Application process. 3. Find benefits that resonate most with the users and can be launched in v1.​

We talked to 10 users, ranging from 20-41 years. These users came from different walks of life and included students, salaried professionals, business owners and self-employed people. We talked to users 1:1, passed them through the CBC application flow and did a card exercise, to cater to our three objectives.

We launched the co-branded card and scaled to issue 890,000 cards which in turn delivered an INR 50cr bottom line for Flipkart and INR 4900cr overall spends in the market.
