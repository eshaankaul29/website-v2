Partial Payment provides a superior customer experience by empowering the customers to bring their credit needs and repayment terms under their own control, preventing them from getting over budget and giving a lifeline to the customers in situations of distress. A customer can avail this option on or before the due date by paying a minimum due amount (including convenience fee) to get the following benefits:1. Extra credit period up to 30-days 2. No Late Payment charges 3.No collection reminders/calls 4.No negative reporting to the credit bureau Continued transactions on Pay Later account.

How will it help Flipkart?

Partial Payment serves a two-pronged goal for Flipkart:
a) Making the Pay Later product self-sustainable through the monetization construct in the form of convenience fee charged to customers to avail this facility to extend the payback period of their outstanding bill and avail extra credit over and above the initial credit period
b) Ties back to the uber goal of improving affordability on the Flipkart platform by enabling the customers to manage unforeseen expenses using the credit construct. It also provides an opportunity to reward high payback intent and increase the trust of the customer on the platform.
