shippedDate: April 2018 - January 2019
overview:
  - Playment is a fully managed data labeling platform that generates training data for computer vision models at scale using crowdsourcing. The motto is to empower companies in the Autonomous Vehicle, Drones, Mapping, and similar spaces with high precision annotation services. We are a young company backed by Y-Combinator and SAIF Partners; we have helped the likes of Nio, Didi Chuxing, University of Washington, Nuro, Drive.ai, and many more to fuel their vision of Autonomous Vehicles.

  - At the core of our platform, is a trained workforce of 300,000+ users (Players/Annotators) managed by their human intelligence experts who build annotation tasks on the training data and deliver results with assured quality.

The challenges and problem solving are critical day-to-day operations of a hyper-growth startup. The efficiency of project management and the product has a direct impact on the scoring revenues. This is exactly the void that we are trying to fill.

Designing for a complex product that involves crowdsourcing was never going to be a piece of cake. Designing an enterprise software is a whole new universe - the constraints, the complexities, the stakeholders, the rules of governance, the features, the functionalities, the technicalities, dozens of personas, and hundreds of use-cases. Itâ€™s all just amazingly thought-provoking.
