When I started my journey with 1THING, I didn’t know I would be handling a brand on my own. A brand which I feel would lie at the core of the knowledge base for our design network. I never expected this to happen. But then again, start-ups.
I’m a designer, and I like doing everything that surrounds it.

Start with Design. Don’t end with it.

Sending a weekly-emailer might sound trivial but that is how the inception of Monochrome started, with an aim to seeding the network with the best news from the world of design, the best practices for their workflow, best tools and resources for their next project, inspiration and designing manners.

Our objective and vision grew in strength parallel to a rapidly growing subscriber base. When Monochrome continued to grow, even with us spending next-to-no time on it, we realized we may be onto something special. Something we needed to explore deeper. We started by dedicating full-days to understand the readers and track the data and build a roadmap for it.

Since then, Monochrome crawled into the inboxes of everyone in the design network and became a go-to newsletter for all their needs. What started as a little engagement activity for our network, grew to become some insanely powerful. Thanks to our network and friends, this small activity grew out to become the best learning of our lives, and it was time we introduced a brand new identity for it — in time for Monochrome’s first meetup.

1THING + Monochrome

When a brand’s visual representation form, in other words, the brand identity, that has been in the market for quite a long period of time, it is difficult for not only for the consumers to adapt to this change, but also proves to be stressful for the decision makers to begin with the practice.

Monochrome was still far from reaching a milestone where its change would be questionable by the entire generation of designers, and that’s the reason we had to begin with a brand identity for us — to lay down the ground principles.

Branding is never about just visual perception or verbal message. Branding is about the whole image people get hearing the name of a company or seeing its brand identity signs. So, designing the signs and symbols which make a brand recognizable and transferring the appropriate message is a job with great responsibility. Still, there is one more stage of the process when this sort of responsibility get another shade. It happens at the point of branding redesign.

Visualization is very personal and perspective driven.
