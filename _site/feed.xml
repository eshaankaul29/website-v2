&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;

Domino’s Pizza is now operating a fleet of more than 2000 autonomous driving vehicles in the city of San Francisco – which has resulted quicker delivery times, and the profit margins for Domino’s has increased manifold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Instead of having a driver driving around on the streets, now a fleet of autonomous cars automatically carry the Pizzas from the kitchen to the customer’s address. Instead of having more than 2000 drivers, this entire system is now managed by 1 single person: the Fleet Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;You have to design a web interface for the fleet manager which will enable him to oversee and manage the entire fleet of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Some pointers to incorporate in the Design of the interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;1.Fleet manager immediately needs to know when any of the self-driving cars has broken down or has been involved in an accident.&lt;br /&gt;
2.Fleet manager should be able to manage and control each individual vehicle – if need arises.&lt;br /&gt;
3.Fleet manager should know the business metrics at all times. Think about what details will be important to display – and what should be the best way to represent them.&lt;br /&gt;
4.Please feel free to make relevant assumptions about the all the other details: geography, charging stations, vehicle health, cameras, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;The problem statement is intentionally a little vague and open ended to see what constrains you define, and the solutions you can come up within them.&lt;/p&gt;
