Card Designs Research Activity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;As a product designer on the CBC team I was on the field, doing research before Flipkart’s Co-branded Card (CBC) went live. We were in Bhopal, India talking to cardholders (Credit or debit), understanding their delight and pain points. ​The objective of the study is threefold: 1. Test the value proposition of Flipkart’s upcoming CBC. 2. Test Usability of CBC Application process. 3. Find benefits that resonate most with the users and can be launched in v1.​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;We talked to 10 users, ranging from 20-41 years. These users came from different walks of life and included students, salaried professionals, business owners and self-employed people. We talked to users 1:1, passed them through the CBC application flow and did a card exercise, to cater to our three objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Designing for a complex product that involves crowdsourcing was never going to be a piece of cake. Designing an enterprise software is a whole new universe - the constraints, the complexities, the stakeholders, the rules of governance, the features, the functionalities, the technicalities, dozens of personas, and hundreds of use-cases. It’s all just amazingly thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;The Challenges and the Problem Solving are a critical day-to-day operations of a hyper-growth startup. The efficiency of project management and the product has a direct impact on the scoring revenues. This is exactly the void that we are trying to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Designing for a complex product which involves crowdsourcing was never going to be a piece of cake. Designing an enterprise software is a whole new universe - the constraints, the complexities, the stakeholders, the rules of governance, the features, the functionalities, the technicalities, dozens of personas, and hundreds of use-cases. It’s all just amazingly thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Adding a place pulls in associated metadata from Apple Maps and gives you a chance to leave a brief note alongside the place, which can be edited later. This note is a good way to remember something key to the experience and it will be visible to those with whom you share the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Both collections and places can be shared. Sharing a collection takes place from the top-level collection view and utilizes your contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;After accepting the sender’s invitation, the receiver’s app imports the sender’s collection, which is visually delineated from the collections the receiver has created on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Accepting a collection from a sender also “subscribes“ the receiver to the collection and means they will receive any future updates from the sender. This feature is meant to open the door for local collections, where you could keep running lists of places and activities in your city.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Work" /><summary type="html">Portion of the first Nomad prototype, built in Swift.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introduction to Generative Art</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introduction to Generative Art" /><published>2018-11-28T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-11-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art.html">&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;My experiments in Processing using various forms of Chaotic equations and visualizing music frequencies to generate art forms.&lt;/p&gt;
