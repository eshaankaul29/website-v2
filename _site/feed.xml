&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Both collections and places can be shared. Sharing a collection takes place from the top-level collection view and utilizes your contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;After accepting the sender’s invitation, the receiver’s app imports the sender’s collection, which is visually delineated from the collections the receiver has created on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Accepting a collection from a sender also “subscribes“ the receiver to the collection and means they will receive any future updates from the sender. This feature is meant to open the door for local collections, where you could keep running lists of places and activities in your city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Adding a place pulls in associated metadata from Apple Maps and gives you a chance to leave a brief note alongside the place, which can be edited later. This note is a good way to remember something key to the experience and it will be visible to those with whom you share the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Both collections and places can be shared. Sharing a collection takes place from the top-level collection view and utilizes your contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;After accepting the sender’s invitation, the receiver’s app imports the sender’s collection, which is visually delineated from the collections the receiver has created on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Accepting a collection from a sender also “subscribes“ the receiver to the collection and means they will receive any future updates from the sender. This feature is meant to open the door for local collections, where you could keep running lists of places and activities in your city.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Work" /><summary type="html">Portion of the first Nomad prototype, built in Swift.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introduction to Generative Art</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introduction to Generative Art" /><published>2018-11-28T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-11-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art.html">&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;My experiments in Processing using various forms of Chaotic equations and visualizing music frequencies to generate art forms.&lt;/p&gt;

Domino’s Pizza is now operating a fleet of more than 2000 autonomous driving vehicles in the city of San Francisco – which has resulted quicker delivery times, and the profit margins for Domino’s has increased manifold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Instead of having a driver driving around on the streets, now a fleet of autonomous cars automatically carry the Pizzas from the kitchen to the customer’s address. Instead of having more than 2000 drivers, this entire system is now managed by 1 single person: the Fleet Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;You have to design a web interface for the fleet manager which will enable him to oversee and manage the entire fleet of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Some pointers to incorporate in the Design of the interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;1.Fleet manager immediately needs to know when any of the self-driving cars has broken down or has been involved in an accident.&lt;br /&gt;
2.Fleet manager should be able to manage and control each individual vehicle – if need arises.&lt;br /&gt;
3.Fleet manager should know the business metrics at all times. Think about what details will be important to display – and what should be the best way to represent them.&lt;br /&gt;
4.Please feel free to make relevant assumptions about the all the other details: geography, charging stations, vehicle health, cameras, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;The problem statement is intentionally a little vague and open ended to see what constrains you define, and the solutions you can come up within them.&lt;/p&gt;
