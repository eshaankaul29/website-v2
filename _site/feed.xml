&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Adding a place pulls in associated metadata from Apple Maps and gives you a chance to leave a brief note alongside the place, which can be edited later. This note is a good way to remember something key to the experience and it will be visible to those with whom you share the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Both collections and places can be shared. Sharing a collection takes place from the top-level collection view and utilizes your contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;After accepting the sender’s invitation, the receiver’s app imports the sender’s collection, which is visually delineated from the collections the receiver has created on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Accepting a collection from a sender also “subscribes“ the receiver to the collection and means they will receive any future updates from the sender. This feature is meant to open the door for local collections, where you could keep running lists of places and activities in your city.&lt;/p&gt;

This note is a good way to remember something key to the experience and it will be visible to those with whom you share the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Both collections and places can be shared. Sharing a collection takes place from the top-level collection view and utilizes your contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;After accepting the sender’s invitation, the receiver’s app imports the sender’s collection, which is visually delineated from the collections the receiver has created on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Accepting a collection from a sender also “subscribes“ the receiver to the collection and means they will receive any future updates from the sender. This feature is meant to open the door for local collections, where you could keep running lists of places and activities in your city.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Work" /><summary type="html">Portion of the first Nomad prototype, built in Swift.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introduction to Generative Art</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introduction to Generative Art" /><published>2018-11-28T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-11-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art.html">&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;My experiments in Processing using various forms of Chaotic equations and visualizing music frequencies to generate art forms.&lt;/p&gt;

Domino’s Pizza is now operating a fleet of more than 2000 autonomous driving vehicles in the city of San Francisco – which has resulted quicker delivery times, and the profit margins for Domino’s has increased manifold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Instead of having a driver driving around on the streets, now a fleet of autonomous cars automatically carry the Pizzas from the kitchen to the customer’s address. Instead of having more than 2000 drivers, this entire system is now managed by 1 single person: the Fleet Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;You have to design a web interface for the fleet manager which will enable him to oversee and manage the entire fleet of vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Some pointers to incorporate in the Design of the interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;1.Fleet manager immediately needs to know when any of the self-driving cars has broken down or has been involved in an accident.&lt;br /&gt;
2.Fleet manager should be able to manage and control each individual vehicle – if need arises.&lt;br /&gt;
3.Fleet manager should know the business metrics at all times. Think about what details will be important to display – and what should be the best way to represent them.&lt;br /&gt;
4.Please feel free to make relevant assumptions about the all the other details: geography, charging stations, vehicle health, cameras, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;The problem statement is intentionally a little vague and open ended to see what constrains you define, and the solutions you can come up within them.&lt;/p&gt;

At 1THING I was able to employ my experience of startups and pour that into 1THING’s various business functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;At 1THING, I was working closely with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashankm19/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shashank Hudkar&lt;/a&gt;, who was the VP - Design, we worked together on 1THING’s core product offering and also accountable for working hands-on some of the most challenging projects revolving around user-centered design, product thinking solutions and UX assignments from clients, such as Paytm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;1THING’s product was a technology-driven, AI-powered Workspace-As-A-Service (WaaS) for startups &amp;amp; businesses. Workspace hired the right design teams for onboarded businesses who we were providing the design services to. This made the collaboration between the businesses and all things design at 1THING far smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-title&quot;&gt;WorkSpace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Our core product offering came in the form of an all-in platform to Hire, Collaborate, and Manage the Design Team. A marketplace model, where a vetted, passionate designer meets his/her, visionary client. We curate a design team based on the client’s requirements and collaborated with them to deliver a great user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-quote&quot;&gt;“Long commutes make you fat, stressed, and miserable. Even short commutes stab at your happiness.” ― Jason Fried&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-title&quot;&gt;Problems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;There were lots of questions. In the first six months, we pretty much ran like an agency. When we looked deeper into the real world case-studies such as Uber &amp;amp; Airbnb. At some point later, we stumbled upon Gigster, which was is ‘Uber’-ising software development. There lay our answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;We decided to build a fully-automated &amp;amp; intelligent design platform of the future, which would combine &amp;amp; Top Design Talent - a platform that would simplify the End-to-End process from Hiring to Collaborationto Delivery. It would also construct a structure in which designers could earn well, deliver quality even when working remotely. This would bring a major transformation in the way product design were currently outsourced. There were advantages for the hiring company too, they would now be able to hire designers from anywhere, save well and attain guaranteed quality. By 2018, we had delivered over 50+ products via a network of 100+ top designers from India &amp;amp; Outside helping companies like PayTM, UAE-Xchange, Tata, RBL Bank, WeddingWire &amp;amp; many many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-quote&quot;&gt;“Technology now allows people to connect anytime, anywhere, to anyone in the world, from almost any device. This is dramatically changing the way people work, facilitating 24/7 collaboration with colleagues who are dispersed across time zones, countries, and continents.”  -  Michael Dell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-title&quot;&gt;Rebranding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;In early 2018, we underwent a major brand overhaul and I worked with Shashank to closely establish the changed ideology behind the company as a strong brand identity. During this activity, I thoroughly researched the best practices of morphing company ethics to a strong visual identity and new trends in the industries. I also went out of my way to try a 3D realism within the Branding and after-effecting my way to a launch video with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartik-lalit-a0390b34/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kartik Lalit.&lt;/a&gt; You can get a glimpse of the concept in the presentation below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-title&quot;&gt;Why Rebrand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;1.Unclear identity. Our logo didn’t serve as an identifying anchor point for the company.&lt;br /&gt;
2.The requirement for an identity which reflects the essence of the company and at the same time is aligned with our new found vision.&lt;br /&gt;
3.We were perceived as just-another-design-company (a marginally improved version of a DA) in almost every way.&lt;br /&gt;
4.Was working like a transactional relationship, rather than an everlasting relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
