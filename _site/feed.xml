&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Partial Payment provides a superior customer experience by empowering the customers to bring their credit needs and repayment terms under their own control, preventing them from getting over budget and giving a lifeline to the customers in situations of distress. A customer can avail this option on or before the due date by paying a minimum due amount (including convenience fee) to get the following benefits:1. Extra credit period up to 30-days 2. No Late Payment charges 3.No collection reminders/calls 4.No negative reporting to the credit bureau Continued transactions on Pay Later account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-title&quot;&gt;How will it help Flipkart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Partial Payment serves a two-pronged goal for Flipkart:
a) Making the Pay Later product self-sustainable through the monetization construct in the form of convenience fee charged to customers to avail this facility to extend the payback period of their outstanding bill and avail extra credit over and above the initial credit period
b) Ties back to the uber goal of improving affordability on the Flipkart platform by enabling the customers to manage unforeseen expenses using the credit construct. It also provides an opportunity to reward high payback intent and increase the trust of the customer on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;~5% users adopted the partial payment feature in the first two months of launch. Flipkart collected a convenience fee of over INR 2cr in profits during the same duration.&lt;/p&gt;

Card Designs Research Activity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;As a product designer on the CBC team I was on the field, doing research before Flipkart’s Co-branded Card (CBC) went live. We were in Bhopal, India talking to cardholders (Credit or debit), understanding their delight and pain points. ​The objective of the study is threefold: 1. Test the value proposition of Flipkart’s upcoming CBC. 2. Test Usability of CBC Application process. 3. Find benefits that resonate most with the users and can be launched in v1.​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;We talked to 10 users, ranging from 20-41 years. These users came from different walks of life and included students, salaried professionals, business owners and self-employed people. We talked to users 1:1, passed them through the CBC application flow and did a card exercise, to cater to our three objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;We launched the co-branded card and scaled to issue 890,000 cards which in turn delivered an INR 50cr bottom line for Flipkart and INR 4900cr overall spends in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Healthcare is a super complex space where great design can both simplify and improve the status quo by an order of magnitude. Under iSpirt, I was fortunate to volunteer on one of the most revolutionary undertaking by the Government of India - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niti.gov.in/writereaddata/files/document_publication/NHS-Strategy-and-Approach-Document-for-consultation.pdf&quot;&gt;National Health Stack (NHS)&lt;/a&gt;, a shared digital healthcare infrastructure, with a view to implementing the Centre’s flagship scheme Ayushman Bharat and other public health care programmes in the country. The NHS is proposed to be the country’s first futuristic nationally shared digital health care infrastructure usable by both the Centre and states across public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;The Challenges and the Problem Solving are a critical day-to-day operations of a hyper-growth startup. The efficiency of project management and the product has a direct impact on the scoring revenues. This is exactly the void that we are trying to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Designing for a complex product which involves crowdsourcing was never going to be a piece of cake. Designing an enterprise software is a whole new universe - the constraints, the complexities, the stakeholders, the rules of governance, the features, the functionalities, the technicalities, dozens of personas, and hundreds of use-cases. It’s all just amazingly thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dz8f2hn5i/image/upload/fl_progressive/v1582746601/PDS/PDS_-_2_u3oa5l.png&quot; alt=&quot;Playment is a fully managed data labeling platform that generates training data for computer vision models at scale using crowdsourcing.

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Adding a place pulls in associated metadata from Apple Maps and gives you a chance to leave a brief note alongside the place, which can be edited later. This note is a good way to remember something key to the experience and it will be visible to those with whom you share the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;Both collections and places can be shared. Sharing a collection takes place from the top-level collection view and utilizes your contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded&quot;&gt;After accepting the sender’s invitation, the receiver’s app imports the sender’s collection, which is visually delineated from the collections the receiver has created on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;Accepting a collection from a sender also “subscribes“ the receiver to the collection and means they will receive any future updates from the sender. This feature is meant to open the door for local collections, where you could keep running lists of places and activities in your city.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Work" /><summary type="html">Portion of the first Nomad prototype, built in Swift.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introduction to Generative Art</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introduction to Generative Art" /><published>2018-11-28T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-11-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/Gen-Art.html">&lt;p class=&quot;post-paragraph-embedded-last&quot;&gt;My experiments in Processing using various forms of Chaotic equations and visualizing music frequencies to generate art forms.&lt;/p&gt;
