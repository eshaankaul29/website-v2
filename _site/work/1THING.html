                <h3>Workspace of the Future Visuals</h3>
                <p class="post-paragraph-embedded">After my stint at Brisky, I joined 1THING in 2017. At 1THING I was able to employ my experience of startups and pour that into 1THING’s various business functions.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded">At 1THING, I was working closely with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashankm19/" target="_blank">Shashank Hudkar</a>, who was the VP - Design, we worked together on 1THING’s core product offering and also accountable for working hands-on some of the most challenging projects revolving around user-centered design, product thinking solutions and UX assignments from clients, such as Paytm.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded">1THING’s product was a technology-driven, AI-powered Workspace-As-A-Service (WaaS) for startups &amp; businesses. Workspace hired the right design teams for onboarded businesses who we were providing the design services to. This made the collaboration between the businesses and all things design at 1THING far smoother.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded-title">WorkSpace</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded">Our core product offering came in the form of an all-in platform to Hire, Collaborate, and Manage the Design Team. A marketplace model, where a vetted, passionate designer meets his/her, visionary client. We curate a design team based on the client’s requirements and collaborated with them to deliver a great user experience.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded-quote">“Long commutes make you fat, stressed, and miserable. Even short commutes stab at your happiness.” ― Jason Fried</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded-title">Problems?</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded">There were lots of questions. In the first six months, we pretty much ran like an agency. When we looked deeper into the real world case-studies such as Uber &amp; Airbnb. At some point later, we stumbled upon Gigster, which was is ‘Uber’-ising software development. There lay our answers.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded">We decided to build a fully-automated &amp; intelligent design platform of the future, which would combine &amp; Top Design Talent - a platform that would simplify the End-to-End process from Hiring to Collaborationto Delivery. It would also construct a structure in which designers could earn well, deliver quality even when working remotely. This would bring a major transformation in the way product design were currently outsourced. There were advantages for the hiring company too, they would now be able to hire designers from anywhere, save well and attain guaranteed quality. By 2018, we had delivered over 50+ products via a network of 100+ top designers from India &amp; Outside helping companies like PayTM, UAE-Xchange, Tata, RBL Bank, WeddingWire &amp; many many more.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded-quote">“Technology now allows people to connect anytime, anywhere, to anyone in the world, from almost any device. This is dramatically changing the way people work, facilitating 24/7 collaboration with colleagues who are dispersed across time zones, countries, and continents.”  -  Michael Dell</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded-title">Rebranding</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded">In early 2018, we underwent a major brand overhaul and I worked with Shashank to closely establish the changed ideology behind the company as a strong brand identity. During this activity, I thoroughly researched the best practices of morphing company ethics to a strong visual identity and new trends in the industries. I also went out of my way to try a 3D realism within the Branding and after-effecting my way to a launch video with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartik-lalit-a0390b34/" target="_blank">Kartik Lalit.</a> You can get a glimpse of the concept in the presentation below.</p>

<p class="post-paragraph-embedded-title">Why Rebrand?</p>
<p class="post-paragraph-embedded-last">1.Unclear identity. Our logo didn’t serve as an identifying anchor point for the company.<br />
2.The requirement for an identity which reflects the essence of the company and at the same time is aligned with our new found vision.<br />
3.We were perceived as just-another-design-company (a marginally improved version of a DA) in almost every way.<br />
4.Was working like a transactional relationship, rather than an everlasting relationship.</p>
