The Door Step School (DSS) provides education and support to the often-forgotten children of pavement and slum dwellers, construction site families and many other underprivileged families. Many of these children are not enrolled in school and have limited access to books and a place to study. Additionally, many of these children are forced to drop out of school to work or care for younger children. With neither support nor resources at home these children too often suffer from very low learning levels. At Door Step School, we are trying to bridge this gap by bringing education to the “Doorstep” of these underprivileged children.
