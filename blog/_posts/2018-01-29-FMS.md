The year is 2025. Domino's Pizza is now operating a fleet of more than 2000 autonomous driving vehicles in the city of San Francisco – which has resulted quicker delivery times, and the profit margins for Domino's has increased manifold.

Instead of having a driver driving around on the streets, now a fleet of autonomous cars automatically carry the Pizzas from the kitchen to the customer's address. Instead of having more than 2000 drivers, this entire system is now managed by 1 single person: the Fleet Manager.

You have to design a web interface for the fleet manager which will enable him to oversee and manage the entire fleet of vehicles.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}
Some pointers to incorporate in the Design of the interface:
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}
1.Fleet manager immediately needs to know when any of the self-driving cars has broken down or has been involved in an accident.<br>
2.Fleet manager should be able to manage and control each individual vehicle – if need arises.<br>
3.Fleet manager should know the business metrics at all times. Think about what details will be important to display – and what should be the best way to represent them.<br>
4.Please feel free to make relevant assumptions about the all the other details: geography, charging stations, vehicle health, cameras, etc.<br>

The problem statement is intentionally a little vague and open ended to see what constrains you define, and the solutions you can come up within them.
