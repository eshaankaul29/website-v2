Catharsis is a project to understand the nuances behind the use of colour in cinematography.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

The graphical posters were made with the use of a python script which exacts the most prominent colour out of each frame of any video. For the love of cinematography in Netflix's Maniac (2018), I decided to decode all its episodes and represent my thoughts behind each episode.

Through this project, I was able to understand and learn python scripting, use of colour in films and set designs; their subsequent impact on establishing the storyline and character personas.
