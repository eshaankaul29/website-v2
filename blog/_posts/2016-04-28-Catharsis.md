Catharsis is a project to understand the nuances behind the use of colour in cinematography.

The graphical posters were made with the use of a python script which exacts the most prominent colour out of each frame of any video. For the love of cinematography in Netflix's Maniac (2018), I decided to decode all its episodes and represent my thoughts behind each episode.
