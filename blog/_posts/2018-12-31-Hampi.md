Photographs from a short trip to Hampi, 2018
{: .post-paragraph-embedded-title}

I took an 8-hour drive to Hampi (beautiful village and temple town), a UNESCO World Heritage site, one of a kind that I have visited so far in India. It is located within the ruins of the city of Vijayanagara, the former capital of the Vijayanagara Empire.
