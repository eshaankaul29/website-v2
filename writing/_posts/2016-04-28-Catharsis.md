Catharsis Is A Project Started To Understand The Nuances Behind The Use Of Colour In Cinematography.
{: .post-paragraph-embedded}

Through This Project, I Was Able To Understand And Learn Python Scripting, Use Of Colour In Films And Set Designs; Their Subsequent Impact On Establishing The Storyline And Character Personas.
